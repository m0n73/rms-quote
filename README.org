* rms-quote

On-demand RMS: questionable quotes on sensitive topics.

** Setup

Place =rms-quote.el= and =rms-quotes.list= in =~/.emacs.d/rms-quote/=.

Add the following lines to your emacs init:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/rms-quote")
(require 'rms-quote)
#+END_SRC

NOTE: This package binds two functions to keys. Modify those lines if these bindings clash with your current setup.
=C-h C-y= to add current line to the quotes.
=C-h C-u= to enjoy yet another pearl from RMS.
